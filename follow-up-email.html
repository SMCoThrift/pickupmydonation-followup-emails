<p>Dear {donor_name},</p>

<p>Thank you for using PickUpMyDonation.com</p>

<p>Please keep in mind that it can take up to 48 hours to be contacted by an organization (possibly longer if submitted over the weekend).  However, if someone has not responded directly there is a chance there was no one in our database who could provide pick up in your area at this time.</p>

<p>In some cases we may not have a non-profit pick up provider in your area, and College Hunks Hauling Junk or 1-800 Got Junk may call to see if they can be of assistance.  They are simply offering their services at a discounted fee if you would like to use them.  There is no obligation and you may thank them for calling and find another means to donate your items.</p>

<p>If that is the case, we hope the below steps will give you some additional tools to help you get your donation to the right place.</p>

<p>1. Contacting local organizations/thrift stores directly <a href="http://thethriftshopper.com/">thethriftshopper.com</a>.<br>
2. Contacting smaller local organizations that may have a need for your particular items.<br>
3. Contacting a local church to see if there is a need in the community.<br>
4. Submitting your information for a fee based Priority PickUp Provider to contact you to schedule a PickUp. Click <a href="https://www.pickupmydonation.com/step-one/?oid=71144&tid=71147&priority=1">HERE</a> to submit your information.</p>

<p>PickUpMyDonation.com is expanding our pick up provider network daily. Again, we hope our service helped find a great home for your donation.  If that was not the case this time around, we hope you know our purpose is to help you by reaching out to multiple organizations on your behalf.  Either way, we hope we have the opportunity to serve you again in the future.</p>

<p>Sincerely,<br>The PickUpMyDonation.com Team</p>
